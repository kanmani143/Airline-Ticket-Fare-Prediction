# Airline-Ticket-Fare-Prediction

**Project Summary**

- Developed a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on features like source, destination, airline, and number of stops.
- The dataset contained flight details such as departure and arrival times, route, and price.
- The goal was to improve pricing predictions, aiding the airline industry in better pricing strategies and demand forecasting.

**Techniques Used**

- Applied regression algorithms, including Decision Trees and Random Forest, for ticket price prediction.
- Used data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, one-hot encoding, label encoding, and feature scaling.
- Evaluated the models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared for performance metrics.
  
**Results and Impact**

- The Random Forest model performed better with a training score of 0.95 and an R-squared value of 0.81.
- Achieved a significant reduction in MAE and MSE, leading to more accurate price predictions.
- The model provided insights into the importance of different features in predicting ticket prices, improving data-driven pricing strategies.

**Conclusion**

- Random Forest proved to be the optimal model for predicting airline ticket prices with a higher accuracy than Decision Tree.
- Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced the performance of the Random Forest model.
- The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in optimizing pricing decisions within the airline industry.
